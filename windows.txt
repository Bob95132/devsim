This is the DEVSIM distribution.  Extract the files from
the archive into your preferred directory.  Product
documentation is available in the devsim/doc directory.

DEVSIM depends on the following 64 bit applications installed on your system:

* Python 2.7
* Tcl 8.5
* Intel MKL

Anaconda Python 2.7
https://continuum.io/download

ActiveTcl 8.5
https://www.activestate.com
* This is only required if you wish to run the Tcl version of DEVSIM.

Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017
https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads

It is necessary to set PATH and PYTHONPATH correctly.

It is recommended to copy c:\Anaconda\python27.dll into the devsim bin directory.  This is to prevent issues when multiple python distributions are on the system.

If you have problems running the software, please file an issue at:
